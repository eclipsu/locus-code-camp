Secure Authentication Practices

Rajeev Shrestha Prastav Pandey Pratik Dahal

Basic Idea:

Our project will develop a secure login portal leveraging various methods for user data storage and implementing multi-factor authentication (MFA) for robust security. We're driven by two clear goals: first, to elevate user safety through a combination of robust data protection and multi-layered login procedures. This means saying goodbye to easily compromised passwords and welcoming secure hashing algorithms alongside diverse **MFA options** like **Gmail verification**, time-based **one-time passwords**, and **FIDO2 security keys**. Every layer adds another brick to the security wall, shielding user credentials from even the most determined attackers.

But security shouldn't come at the cost of convenience. Our second goal is to deliver a seamless user experience. We'll keep the login interface simple and intuitive, giving users clear instructions and ensuring smooth integration with their preferred MFA methods. The result? A login process that feels familiar and effortless, all while keeping sensitive information safe under an impenetrable guard.

This robust blend of security and user-friendliness paves the way for a future where online logins are safer than ever before. Our secure login portal has the potential to transform personal accounts, e-commerce platforms, and countless other applications, fostering trust and peace of mind in the digital realm. By putting user safety first, we're building a brighter, more secure tomorrow for everyone who ventures online.
